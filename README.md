# Aura Therapy 

## Improve your mental health

### Inspiration

There are plenty of available resources to help, but often the non-profit options may not be user-friendly and the ones for-profit have limited information or lack of data sharing platform. So we have created Aura.

### What it does?

Aura provides one click help (directly populating/dialing/texting) to available hotlines services reverse service lookup for the therapist to reach out sharing profile and assessment between services (no need transfer data)

### How do we build it?

* Python 
* Django 
* Google Cloud | Map Platform

### Challenges we ran into

Time is always a challenge, but we built what we can!

### Accomplishments that we are proud of
